                        <h3>Donald Walbridge Shirley (January 29, 1927 – April 6, 2013)</h3>
                        <p>was an American classical and jazz pianist and composer. He recorded many albums for Cadence
                            during the 1950s and 1960s, experimenting with jazz with a classical influence. He wrote
                            organ symphonies, piano concerti, a cello concerto, three string quartets, a one-act opera,
                            works for organ, piano and violin, a symphonic tone poem based on the novel Finnegans Wake
                            by James Joyce, and a set of "Variations" on the legend of Orpheus in the Underworld.</p>

                            <p>Donald Walbridge Shirley was born on January 29, 1927, in Pensacola, Florida, to Jamaican
                                immigrants, Stella Gertrude (1903–1936), a teacher, and Edwin S. Shirley (1885–1982), an
                                Episcopal priest.
                                Shirley started to learn piano when he was two years old. He briefly enrolled at
                                Virginia State University and Prairie View College, then studied with Conrad Bernier and
                                Thaddeus Jones at Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he received
                                his bachelor’s degree in music in 1953.
                                Known as "Dr. Shirley," he had two honorary doctorates.
                                His birthplace was sometimes incorrectly given as Kingston, Jamaica, because his label
                                advertised him as being Jamaican-born.
                                According to his nephew, Edwin, his record label falsely claimed that he studied music
                                in Europe in order to "make him acceptable in areas where a Black man from a Black
                                school wouldn’t have got any recognition at all."</p>
